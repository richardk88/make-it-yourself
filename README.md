## App Overview

Make-It-Yourself is a "DIY" application where a user can go in and upload a project that he or she has created to share with the rest of the world. Users can start by creating a user dashboard, add new projects to that dashboard, and add steps that will be added to that specific project. 

This application is intended to bring users together by creating a platform where people can share their ideas, unique hobbies, and interests to make this world a more interesting place.
